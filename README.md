Sparkbuilder
================

Sparkbuilder for "[Megam cloud platform](https://www.megam.io)". The Sparkbuilder builds a git repo which contains analytics template code based on machine learning using gradle natively.

We don't spin process, but natively integrate to Gradle using its tooling API.

## How can use this ?

Two ways, sbt or gradle.

## sbt

```

resolvers += "Bintray megamsys" at "https://dl.bintray.com/megamsys/scala/"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq("io.megam" %% "sparkbuilder" % "0.4")

```


### gradle

```
  repositories {
      maven {
        url 'http://dl.bintray.com/megamsys/scala'
      }
    }

    dependencies {
      compile 'io.megam:sparkbuilder_2.11:0.4'
   }

```

## How do i build jars ?

Any git repo provided as input shall be built using gradle. You don't need gradle to be installed.

The below code build the project `https://github.com/megamsys/sparkbuilder.git` in `MEGAM_HOME/yonpis`

```scala

val yp = YonpiProject(new GitRepo(
  new java.io.File(sys.env("MEGAM_HOME") + java.io.File.separator + "megamgateway" + java.io.File.separator + "yonpis/sparkbuilder").getAbsolutePath, "https://github.com/megamsys/sparkbuilder.git"))

yp.buildJar()

yp.buildJar(true) //cleans the repo and build a clean jar.

```

The jars reside in `$MEGAM_HOME/megamgateway/yonpis/<reponame>/build/lib/<reponame>.jar`



## Where are we heading ?

Our yonpis can be used to predict using our custom built analytics workbench based on industry.

Yonpis' will get launched on a spark cluster using the jobserver API client available in [megamgateway](https://github.com/megamsys/megam_gateway.git)

### Publishing to bintray

Update the version flag in build.gradle. Refer our internal documentation (Build Megam) for the user/apikey details


```
